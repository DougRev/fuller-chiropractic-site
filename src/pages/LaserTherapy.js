          Also called photobiomodulation therapy, low-level laser is designed to repair tissue, reduce pain and inflammation, and increase range of motion.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How Laser Therapy Works</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
          At Fuller Chiropractic, we use the advanced Erchonia Low Level Laser to help restore your body's natural function and improve your overall well-being. This non-invasive treatment utilizes phototherapy to penetrate deeply into the skin, repairing damaged cells and restoring their ability to function within normal parameters.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Restoring Muscle Strength and Function</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
          One of the most common uses of the laser in our office is to restore strength to weakened muscle groups. This can happen due to injury or improper movement patterns, often leading to chronic pain. Many of our patients are surprised to learn they have weak muscle groups in areas such as the core, lower back, neck, and shouldersâ€”muscles they weren't even aware of being affected. These weaknesses can contribute to pain and strain throughout the body, including the spine, extremities, and jaw.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What to Expect</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
          The Laser Therapy Protocol typically consists of 6 to 10 treatments, but many patients experience noticeable improvements after just the first session. As the body begins to function at an optimal level, core stability is enhanced, range of motion is increased, and patients report improvements in coordination, balance, and control over their movements. Additionally, the laser's programmable technology allows us to target specific conditions, effectively reducing inflammation due to sprains, strains, and even post-surgical recovery.
